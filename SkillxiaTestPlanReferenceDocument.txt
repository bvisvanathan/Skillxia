3 threadgroups initiated to test performance as below..

ThreadGroup - Single 

No of threads - 1
Rampup period - 1
Loopcount - 1

ThreadGroup - Multiple 

No of threads - 100
Rampup period - 1
Loopcount - 1

ThreadGroup - Loop 

No of threads - 1
Rampup period - 1
Loopcount - 100

Observation

when running threadgroup under loop it takes time since 100 loops need to be
executed for a single thread which is different from simultaneous execution 
of multiple threads but all tests are scuccesfull..
